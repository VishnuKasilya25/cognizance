## <span style = "color:yellow;" > WHAT IS PRODUCTIVITY IN EDUCATION? </span>
* Productivity in education pertains to maximized and quality learning. In a high-productive classroom, students know what they need to do and how to go about the task at hand. In productive classrooms, the communication between students and teachers is clear from the beginning.
* When classrooms are productive, students don’t have to wait around for instructions. Teachers ensure they provide enough learning activities for the students. The teachers also develop lesson plans to make sure the classrooms are full of life.
* Ultimately, high classroom productivity in most cases depends on the teacher, rather than on the students. It’s more about how the teachers dictate student productivity and performance.

## <span style = "color:pink;" > __WHY PRODUCTIVITY APP?__ </span>
+ 	Being a student isn’t easy, and with distractions all around us, it isn’t surprising that many of us find it challenging to organize our time or to stay focused on our studies.
+ 	As a student, time management is not only an essential skill to find success in your academics, but it also allows you to make time for other passions, and to take care of yourself and your mental health.
